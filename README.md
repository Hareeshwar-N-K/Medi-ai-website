# 🌐 NeuralCare: AI-Powered Rural Healthcare Platform

**Transforming Disease Detection & Preventive Healthcare with AI**

NeuralCare is a cutting-edge initiative focused on empowering underserved and rural communities through advanced, accessible, and AI-driven healthcare solutions. This project leverages artificial intelligence for early disease detection, preventive alerts, and health diagnostics—bridging gaps where traditional healthcare struggles to reach.

---

## 🏆 Built for the ACM Hackathon

This project was ideated, developed, and presented as part of the **ACM Hackathon**, showcasing innovative solutions in the field of **AI-driven healthcare for rural impact**. NeuralCare was designed under the constraints of rapid prototyping and team collaboration, with a strong focus on **real-world relevance** and **scalability**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔬 AI-Powered Early Diagnosis
- **Tuberculosis (TB):** Detects TB from chest X-rays with over 90% accuracy.
- **Malaria:** AI-based microscopic parasite detection in just 20 seconds.
- **Anemia:** Medical image and blood test-based AI detection with preventive alerts.
- **Pneumonia:** AI-driven X-ray classification for rapid lung infection diagnosis.

### 🌦 Weather-Linked Health Insights *(developed locally)*
- Context-aware disease warnings based on weather data.
- Especially useful for conditions like anemia (heat fatigue), pneumonia (cold-triggered), and malaria (post-rainfall spikes).

### 🩺 Real-Time Diagnosis *(developed locally)*
- Locally hosted system for instant image and data-based disease analysis.
- Enhances early medical intervention and reduces diagnostic delays.

### 🤖 ChatBot for Healthcare Guidance *(developed locally)*
- A supportive chatbot for common symptoms, health education, and first-response advice.
- Developed and tested on a personal machine; not yet hosted on GitHub.

### 🏥 Bridging the Rural Healthcare Gap
- Offline-first, lightweight architecture suitable for low-resource or internet-limited areas.
- Enables health workers to deliver fast, AI-assisted care in the field.
